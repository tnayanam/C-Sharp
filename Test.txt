A namespace is used to organize classes, other namespaces, delegates, interfaces. etc. hello
By default, LINQ is deferred execution

Deferred Execution: Query is not executed at the point of declaration
	Example: Select, SelectMany, Take, Skip
Immediate Execution: Query is executed at the point of declaration
	Example: First, Last, SingleToList, ToArray
	
	Benefits: Query construction and execution is decoupled, thus we can decouple them.
			  A deferred execution query is reevaluated whtn ran thus it alwasy gets the latest data.	
			  Performance Kill is the down point.
			  
Example
DataContext context = new DataContext();
var query = from customer in context.Customers
 where customer.City == "Delhi"
 select customer; // Query does not execute here
 
 foreach (var Customer in query) // Query executes here
 {
 Console.WriteLine(Customer.Name);
 }
//
